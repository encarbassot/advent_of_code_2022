# Advent of code 2022

All this code may look sketchy, because it is :)

I only had few Hours to do each code while going to classes and while working

also the first week i was in a bike trip so i did this even more sketchy HTML that loads each script

because i had to code with my phone for the first week, (where i've lost the a big amount of my points for not being able to code comftable)
and also some days we woke up in places with no signal, so i had to walk up to 500m in the cold to get the input

but i dont regret it, it was an amazing experience waking up in the mide of the forests of mallorca at 6am to code while watching the sunrise.
